		  <h1>A new gardener let loose in the Algarve</h1>
		  <p>We are becoming gluttons since coming to live in rural Algarve. As each fruit or vegetable comes into season, gluts come thick and fast. We are gluttons for fava beans, then globe artichokes, then loquats and soon it will be plums. People try to give us the gluts we are already glutted with and buckets of beans, plums or strawberries get passed from hand to hand in the hope that nothing will be wasted. Hopefully, it is all processed, but trying to pick, wash and deal with it can be hard work and I have been busy scratching my head about what to do with the bountiful harvest.</p>
		  <img src="image/P4090513-575x431.jpg" alt="">
		  <p>The year begins with oranges and lemons. Luckily we have a friend who makes the best marmalade and lemon curd in the world. We love it both on toast and on sticky pork ribs, which are plentiful here as the Portuguese love pork. In the old days, any gluts would be fed to the family pig kept for such purposes, delivered with an affectionate scratch of the ear and a little tear in the eye from the farmer’s wife when the succulent porker is turned into sausages and served at a family festa in the autumn. We got bagfuls of lemons after a branch of a neighbour’s tree fell down and I was at a loss about what to do with them. I remembered that my brother had searched in vain for preserved lemons on a visit to us to cook a Tagine and as we have no lack of good quality sea salt thought I’d give it a go. You just cut lemons nearly in quarters and stuff them full of salt basically. Add some peppercorns and bay leaves and top up with lemon juice, leave for four weeks or so and that’s it! You get rid of the pulp and use the peel in Tagines. I await the results with excitement!</p>
          <img src="image/P5130214-345x575.jpg" alt="">
          <p>I am not a Domestic Goddess, much preferring the garden to the kitchen, so the other way of dealing with a glut of fruit is to preserve it in alcohol. Luckily vodka is relatively cheap here, so when we received a glut of the sweetest tangerines I soaked them in sugar and vodka and hope to drink the resulting liquor at Christmas. Mind you, I can hardly bear to eat any of it; it all looks so pretty in the jars. Lemons and Oranges can also be frozen whole if you just want to use the peel later and if you want to juice them, you can dry the peel for use as fire lighters, as they are full of natural oil. The first signs of Spring, In January here, are accompanied by a wild asparagus hunt. The hills are full of this prickly bush, whose young spears make special hors d’oeuvres. Since the country folk hereabouts also love these Spring treats you have to get out early or have a favourite secret spot to forage them. Go armed with gloves and a sharp knife and prepare to receive the odd wound on your quest! It’s hard to have too much of this delicacy, but there does come a point when you can even get fed up with eating the spears, which need to be boiled a little longer than cultivated spears as they are quite bitter, but delicious served with butter and black pepper.</p>
          <img src="image/P41105161-575x431.jpg" alt="">
		  <p>Next come the fava beans or broad beans. There is much stroking of chins over when to plant these and how they are getting on. The change in temperature from year to year, lack of rainfall or severe downpours and the fierce winds can make the harvest a dodgy business. The Portuguese let the beans grow big and fat and dry them to use in stews and soups throughout the year. We pick them younger, blanch and freeze them and delicious they are too. Peas are also grown this way and they too are subject to seasonal vagaries and I have met farmers who have lost their whole crop due to a very strong wind just at the point of flowering. In the garden at the moment, I have a glut of globe artichokes and loquats. My father taught me to eat Globe artichokes and we used to buy them in Wales in ones or twos in season and see them as a delicacy, boiling them and then dipping the base of the flower heads in butter and black pepper and nibbling on them until we got to the best bit, the heart. I wonder what he would have thought if he could see the heap of them I  brought up from the garden yesterday! Their cousins, the Cardoons, grow wild near our house and the petals of these are used as a sort of rennin for making cheese thicken. I spend a happy hour or so in the shade in the porch, knocking out earwigs which the chickens gobble up and taking all the petals off until I get to the hearts. We eat them like potatoes, drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. They do have a slightly unfortunate effect on the digestive system, but are delicious and once char grilled can be preserved in olive oil.</p>

          <p>Finally, I have been picking loquats until they are coming out of my ears. I have been coming to the Algarve for some years and have never had a harvest like this one. Loquat trees don’t like the heavy downpours we sometimes have, but this year we have had little rain and the trees are dripping with their golden fruit. When they are really ripe they are delicious, sweet and juicy, with a taste that’s a cross between peach and grape. The birds love them, but there are so many, they are welcome to take their share. Rather than make jam, I lobbed them in the slow cooker with some dried apricots (that’s another story, they dry wonderfully in the sun) ginger and mustard seed, cider vinegar and sugar and went to bed. It made the most delicious chutney with very little effort.</p>

		  <p>And don’t forget the herbs and flowers; we have gluts of these too. Lavender can be picked, made into bunches and dried in a dark place and oregano flower stalks can be dried and used in cooking throughout the year. Marigold flowers can be dried too and steeped in olive oil to make an infusion which is very good for sunburn and other skin problems. Mint and other herbs can be chopped and put into ice cubes for use later on in the year. Portuguese people in the country are very generous with their gluts and you can always give them something in return. A present of eggs and lemons can be returned in the form of a lemon meringue pie. Cabbage leaves can be given to chickens for feed in return for eggs. What goes around comes around, and swapping fruit and vegetables is a great solution to any surplus.It’s a good feeling!</p>
